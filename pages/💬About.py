    """## What is veCHR?
veCHR is 'CHR' locked for voting power.

## What is the utility of veCHR?
Voting on liquidity pools and directing $CHR emissions to them, while at the same time earning from swap fees and gauge bribes proportional to their vote on the liquidity pool(s).

## What do veCHR voters receive?
- Trading fees generated by the pool(s) they vote for
- Bribes deposited for the pools they vote for
- Weekly veCHR distribution (rebase)

## Why this Tracker?
This was created by me aka üçìALMIGHTY ABEüçì to fill the gap of NFT marketplaces not showcasing Financial NFTs properly and making veNFT metadata user-friendly.
